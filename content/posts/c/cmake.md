# Cmake Guide

So far the best build system I have found is Cmake. It is very important
to me to have cross platform code and build systems.

I have found an awesome [YouTube video series by vector-of-bool](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkYGy96LXk3g-d6kP22aSDA/playlists)
that has been the most helpful resource for getting started.

Very useful blog post by [Dane Bulat](https://dane-bulat.medium.com/cmake-how-to-inspect-and-configure-the-compiler-877e6cb0317f)

## Install Latest Version Linux

Go to [Cmake website downloads page](https://cmake.org/download/)

## Setup Release And Debug Builds

It is very easy to setup different releases. [This stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7724569/debug-vs-release-in-cmake)
page makes it clear.
