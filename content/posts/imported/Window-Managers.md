# Window Managers

## Linux

[awesomewm](awesomewm) is well, awesome.

## Windows

### Static Window Manager

[PowerToys](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys) is a set of tools, one of
which can be a basic window manager. Fancy Zones is the name of the tool that
does this. I do not love this app because it is very mouse oriented.

None the less, it does have other tools that are helpful.

### Workspacer

Enter [Workspacer](https://workspacer.org/), finally something that is
comparable to many Linux based window managers.
