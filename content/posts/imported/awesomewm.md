# awesomewm

What is [awesomewm](https://awesomewm.org/)?

From their own website description:

> awesome is a highly configurable, next generation framework window manager for X.
> It is very fast, extensible and licensed under the GNU GPLv2 license.
> It is primarily targeted at power users, developers and any people dealing
> with every day computing tasks and who want to have fine-grained control on
> their graphical environment.

## Install

The install process is different for every Linux distro.
[This guide](https://awesomewm.org/download/) can help you find your distro's instructions to install.

## Why Awesome WM Is Awesome

Reasons why I think awesome wm is totally awesome!

- Configuration is done with lua. I think lua is the simplest programming
  language and is great for allowing you to do what you want.
- It makes working with graphical applications easy
- Route applications of a certain type to a group just for those related items.
  For example, all document editing programs like LibreOffice, Okular, etc. can
  all be automatically routed to my documents tab when they are opened.
- Great shortcuts for moving between applications.

## My Configuration

My awesome lua configuration can be found in
[MyCrossPlatformDotfiles](https://github.com/derekthecool/MyCrossPlatformDotfiles)
GitHub repository.

Specifically the link to the primary config file
[rc.lua](https://github.com/derekthecool/MyCrossPlatformDotfiles/blob/2a36987565fd27e3175aa79dc61417cb95a91e98/.config/awesome/rc.lua)
