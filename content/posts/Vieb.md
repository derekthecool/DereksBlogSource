# Vieb

[Vieb](https://vieb.dev/) is a web browser with vim bindings such as `j` and `k`
to move up and down. Unlike plugins for popular browsers, this feature is built
in by design.

In case you're wondering how to pronounce the word `Vieb` let me share the tip
from the main website:

> Vieb is pronounced like "deep" with a "v" and rhymes with sheep

Here is a screenshot of the method used to "click" on a link, press `f` to enter
this mode.

And this is shows the built in search feature, just press `/`, who has time for
`Ctrl+f` these days? Press `n` to search forward and `N` to search backwards.
