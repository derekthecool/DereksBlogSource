# My Journey Into Stenography

Let me share my empowering journey of how I discovered stenography.
I have been using steno for all my interactions with a computer for nearly a
year. I use steno for all of my work as an embedded systems engineer and
anything else I do at a computer. Once you find the true power of stenography
offers compared to normal keyboard input, you can never to back.

## The Moment I First Heard Of Stenography And Plover

Shortly after my second child was born I was reading the monthly blog post from
[zsa]() while feeding the baby a bottle. I had just purchased a
[moonlander keyboard]() earlier that year and had been enjoying reading updates
shared in these monthly blogs. Most articles discuss changes to their firmware
builder web interface or mention of adding some new feature. I was not expecting
a fundamental change to how I use a computer and would cause me to never use a
normal keyboard again.

The life changing article is titled
[Stenography with ZSA Keyboards: A Tutorial](https://blog.zsa.io/2107-steno-tutorial/)
by [Paul Fioravanti](https://www.paulfioravanti.com/). I've always been easily
tempted by producttivity boosts and tech hacks. So when I read about the
benefits of stenography with phrases like these I had to try it.
